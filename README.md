# MassSpecTrigger

Intended to be called by Thermo Xcalibur after processing. Called after every RAW file is finished.

Should be added to Xcalibur as "post-processing" command, with a call similar to this:

`D:\Automation\MassSpecTrigger.exe %R`

`%R` sends the complete path to each RAW file.

There should be a single SLD file in the same directory as the RAW file. The SLD file should contain the sequence of all RAW files that will be generated by this run.

Uses the ThermoFisher RawFileReader 7.x libraries, and should be compatible with .NET 7.x.
